# tradingindicators

I previously ran an online store that allowed me to combine my passion for trading and algorithmic indicators. The store featured a range of proprietary trading indicators written in PineScript, focusing on strategies based on Stochastic RSI, TMA, and MA. Alongside these, I authored an original book on cryptocurrency creation and offered free resources for building trading bots on Spotware’s cTrader platform.

Driven by my interest in cTrader, I delved into developing cBots using Spotware’s cAPI, creating simple trading strategies. These cBots, equipped with built-in backtesting panels, were designed to be accessible, enabling anyone to download, modify, and enhance them for more effective and profitable trading outcomes.

# challenges : 

Doing this kind of business, it's hard to come to an agreement with payment operators. For this reason, the store was closed irretrievably.

# note : 
This project is no longer actively supported, and the available code is provided as-is. (basically uncommented mess)

# tradingindicators

I had a store that allowed me to monetize my interest in the topic of trading and trading indicators.
There were proprietary trading indicators, my original book on creating cryptocurrencies and free bases for creating trading bots for Spotware cTrader.

The store offered trading indicators written in the PineScript language, which are based on the Stochastic RSI, TMA and MA.

Since I really like trading with cTrader from Spotware, I decided to explore the topic of creating cBots.
With a built-in panel for backtesting strategies and relatively simple programming thanks to cAPI, I created some simple strategies that anyone can download for free and develop to make them more effective and profitable.
